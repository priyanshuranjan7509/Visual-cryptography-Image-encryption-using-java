# Visual-cryptography-Image-encryption-using-java
This project aims to Encrypt and Decrypt Images based on different algorithms like RSA ,DSA AND AES  providing Authentication and using Image Hash functions for additional Security and Integrity of images. This project also makes sure the Image retains its quality and is not corrupted even after decryption.
